# How to Install
## Before installing...
There is things you need to note before installing:
* Please do a clean install (Empty anything related to existing MMOD inside sourcemods folder) before proceeding.
* You need to download games you want MMod to work with, you MUST have them installed. (For example if you want to play Half-Life 2: Update with MMod you need to download it from steam and then launch it through steam library named MMOD, and that goes to every game)
* Make sure to have all these games including MMod installed on the same local hard disk as your steam installation. (e.g. C:/ or D:/ or E:/)

## Installing MMOD
1. Download and open the `HL2MMod_1.3_Fixed.1.zip` with any archive software.
2. Put all 10 folders inside the folder named "PUT THESE INTO SOURCEMODS DIRECTORY", into `(Your local directory goes here)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\`.
3. That's not all! Listen carefully, lad. Download and open the `HL2MMod_Fixes_and_Enhancements_v1.rar` with any archive software, just like what you did. (Attention to Linux users: you should use unrar through command-line if there is any, most archive software sadly does not support unrar and displays an error, this is confirmed on GNOME)
1. Put all 10 folders located from "HL2MMod_Fixes_and_Enhancements_v1" from, into `(Your local directory goes here)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\`.
2. Extract the contents of the folder to your sourcemods folder. (If you are asked to overwrite files, please do so)
3. Restart your Steam client.

Also in case of you being confused: DO NOT PUT just single file named above. you must put all 10 folders. Okay?!

## Installing this modpack
1. Extract the archive file you downloaded (It should be `.zip`, `.rar`, or `.7z`)
2. Put the folder or vpk file to `sourcemods/HL2MMOD/custom` folder inside Local Files (To access local files, Go to Properties -> Local Files -> Browse...)
	* 2-1. **Attention to Linux/macOS Users!** If the folder contains uppercase and space, you must rename the folder to contain only lowercase/underscore otherwise the game cannot detect the folder mod(s) upon launch!
3. Launch the game, enjoy the modpack!
