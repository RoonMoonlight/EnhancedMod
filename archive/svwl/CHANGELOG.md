# Changelog
## 5.1 "Bergenia" (April 26, 2022)
Another spring, another natural update. Welcome to first update of Stardew Valley: Wildlife! This update might probably be the last update which is based on bloated branch. This update mainly includes new fashion system and several changes to industrial system.

### Highlights
* Major environment visual overhaul has arrived on experimental branch! The environment has been recolored and some elements are now randomized, while keeping original Stardew Valley atmospheres.
* New feature: Building mode! Now it is quicker and easier to build your own farm without having to build it slowly. This feature might be useful for builders!
* Crafting UI has been improved! Now it features categories, favorites, uniform grid size and some exploit fixes.
* New hairstyles, cosmetics, and Hand Mirror item! Now with Hand Mirror item, you don't have to start all over again to change your looks anymore.
* Replaced Official - Industrialization to PFM version due to the mod being outdated and no longer updated anymore, we decided to change the mod base of industrialization mod to PFM version.
* [Karei](https://twitter.com/flat_fish_)'s portrait mod(Fisharia portrait mod) has been changed to Unofficial CP version (Now simply put the folder into Mods folder and you are done!)
* Removed Real Weather due to issue with mechanics (This mod will not be added back into the game in the future)
* Now NPC locations are displayed on the map! Now you don't need to miss opportunity to talk to npcs or miss your remaining quests anymore.
* There was an earthquake on your farm... Now your farm have been expanded for better farming!
* Node textures has been improved to match their surroundings based on current environment and other colors of nearby rocks.
