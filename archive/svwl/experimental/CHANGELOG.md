Say hello to new original Stardew Valley NPC, Aspen! Aspen is a new NPC who lives on her own farm west of the railroads! She got screwed over with

Gus was nice enough to let her stay at the Saloon until then.

This is original NPC created by Invatorzen. **Please do note that all content related to Aspen is a Non-Canon.**

* **Major environment visual overhaul has arrived on experimental branch!** The environment has been recolored and some elements are now randomized, while keeping original Stardew Valley atmospheres.

* **New hairstyles, cosmetics, and Hand Mirror item!** Now with Hand Mirror item, you don't have to start all over again to change your looks anymore.
