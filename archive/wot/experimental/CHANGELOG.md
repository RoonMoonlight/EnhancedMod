## 2.0-2022.17a "Treffaswagen"
Welcome to first experimental release of Great Tank Battle! This experimental update is now rebased on WGMods Essential and we are officially starting to ditch Aslain's Mod for following reasons:
* Frequent Mod list changes and so many bloats included on the modpack
* Installs Aslain's Mod Log Archiver without user's consent
* Officially encourages user to use XVM
* And Category sorting is worst compared with other modpack installers

Additionally Great Warships Battle will also be ditching Aslain's Mod and will be replaced with ModStation installer.

This release is based on ModStation v0.12.0 (Not officially released yet) and first major changes to the modpack. We will continuously be adding more changes to experimental branch as soon as new mods appear in the installer.

### Highlights
* **Officially ditched Aslain's Modpack and now uses official installer like WGMods and ModStation installer.**
* Many changes has been made to list of mods, especially better category
