The reason we decided to create this modpack is because to prove that Team Fortress 2 Community is still alive, and to prove that we are always on community rather than relying on Valve.

The objective of this modpack is to be 100% community-maintained, meaning that you can make issue, pull request to this modpack. (But make sure your issue, pull request adheres to EnhancedMod standard before you proceed)

We, Mystic Moonlight will stick with community, and even the IP holder stops me from creating our mod, we will.

Even Valve or Take Two Interactive tries to take down one of our mods, we will never stop creating things for our community.
