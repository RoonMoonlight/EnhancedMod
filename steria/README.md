# DISCLAIMER
1.19.3 has been released. Yes we are aware of this changes, and will be fully updated to support 1.19.3 soon. Thank you all for your patience!

# Steria - The community-made alternative modpack for Minecraft
Steria(A.K.A Asteria) is the Lite Edition of Kosmos, aiming to optimize vanilla client while not adding pvp-exclusive features, like standalone version of OptiFine. It is sister project of main modpack Cosmos.

This modpack currently supports from 1.19 to 1.19.2! If the mod says it is not compatible due to minor update, feel free use old version in the meantime.

**Steria for 1.19.3 is still on beta. Things might not be stable and may subject to change.**
