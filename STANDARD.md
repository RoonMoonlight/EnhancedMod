# EnhancedMod - Our Standards
Welcome to EnhancedMod! Here is the standard we follow when making the EnhancedMod and sister projects. We recommend you to read everything when creating your own modpack in the future!

Last update: Oct 29, 2022

### Try to give users choice
Rather than using mods which forces specific features, give the options to users instead. We do not prefer the mods which forces specific features.

### Do not try to change the game too much
Our project is to revamp and give fresh-new style the original game with mods, while keeping original gameplay as much as possible. Keep game-changing mods to the minimum.

### Only originals are accepted with some exceptions
We only adds mod which uses original/self-made content. We do not tolerate adding things that is from other franchises or games. (e.g. Games, Artwork, Franchises which doesn't present in-game)

There is exception of this case, if there is no better replacement of sound effects, you may add it; as long as they are community-made project(e.g. Black Mesa, Raising the Bar: Redux, Team Fortress 2 Classic, etc.) or same franchise owner of the game.
However try to reduce the percentage of non-original content if there is better alternatives. We aims to keep the original content at least over 80%.

### Performance matters
Performance is really important for better gameplay experience. Never add mod which can affect performance unless it does the opposite, which improves performance.

### Always remember the fair-play
We always focus fair-play experience for all player, and do not want to give users unfair advantage compared to other users. We also strictly not allows adding mod which can affect the gameplay.

### No more limitations: Cross-platform
Regardless of any platform, the mod should follow the cross-platform support, so people can enjoy the same gameplay experience regardless of which platform they play on.

This cross-platform standard is exception for [ModernMod project](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/ModernMod).
