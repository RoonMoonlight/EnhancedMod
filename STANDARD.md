### Do not try to change game too much
Our project is to revamp and give fresh-new style the original game with mods, while keeping original gameplay as much as possible. Keep game-changing mods to the minimum.

### Only originals are accepted with some exceptions
We only adds mod which uses original/self-made content. We do not tolerate adding things that is from other franchises or games. (e.g. Games, Artwork, Franchises which doesn't present in-game)

There is exception of this case, if there is no better replacement of sound effects, you may add it; as long as they are community-made project(e.g. Black Mesa, Raising the Bar: Redux, Team Fortress 2 Classic, etc.) or same franchise owner of the game.
However try to reduce the percentage of non-original content if there is any alternatives. We aims to keep the original content at least over 80%.

### Performance matters
Performance is really important for better gameplay experience. Never add mod which can affect performance unless it does the opposite (Which improves performance)

### Always remember the fair-play
We always focus fair-play experience for all player, and do not want to give users unfair advantage compared to other users. We also strictly not allows adding mod which can affect the gameplay.

### No more limitations: Cross-platform
Regardless of any platform, the mod should follow the cross-platform support, so people can enjoy the same gameplay experience regardless of which platform they play on.
